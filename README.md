# Predictive Sales Forecasting Dashboard for Regional Variance Analysis

**Overview:**

This project develops a sales performance dashboard that forecasts regional sales performance and identifies areas of high potential and underperformance.  The analysis allows for targeted resource allocation to maximize sales growth and optimize business strategies.  The dashboard leverages predictive modeling techniques to provide insightful visualizations and key performance indicators (KPIs).

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* [Add other libraries used here, e.g., scikit-learn, statsmodels]


**How to Run:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Application:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will perform the sales forecasting and generate the dashboard outputs.


**Example Output:**

The script will print a summary of the sales forecasting analysis to the console, including key statistics and insights about regional performance.  Additionally, the following files will be generated in the project directory:

* `sales_trend.png`: A line plot visualizing the sales trends over time for each region.
* `regional_performance.png`: A bar chart comparing the sales performance of different regions.
* [Add other generated files here, e.g., `forecast_data.csv`]

**Data:**

The project requires a CSV file named `sales_data.csv` in the project's root directory. This file should contain the necessary sales data, including at minimum:  `Region`, `Date`, and `Sales`.  A sample `sales_data.csv` is provided in the repository.  Please update this file with your own data for accurate analysis.
